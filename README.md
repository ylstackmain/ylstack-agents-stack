# Downy

Build a team of agents and work with them from any device.

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/ylstack1/downy)

- Best UX for working with multiple agents.
- Each agent has its own personality, skills, tools, and workspace.
- OpenAI Sub compatible for frontier models at a flat rate. Or, use any model on OpenRouter or Workers AI.

## Why Downy

- **Self-hosted.**
  - Runs in your Cloudflare account or locally.
- **Multi-agent w/ purpose built UX.**
  - Each agent has its own personality, skills, tools, and workspace.
  - Manage workspaces, tools, and background tasks directly in the app — no Obsidian, no CLI.
- **Use w/ any Model, including your OpenAI Sub.**
  - Kimi 2.6 on Workers AI by default — no API keys to wire up.
  - Swap in [ChatGPT Plus/Pro](#optional-chatgpt-subscription) or any OpenRouter model when you want.
- **Access anywhere.**
  - Reach Downy from any device behind Cloudflare's secure network.

## How does it work?

I had been meaning to make something like Downy for a while, but this blog post made me actually build it: https://blog.cloudflare.com/project-think/. I highly recommend reading it if you want to understand how Downy works. But, basically each agent and subagent is its own Durable Object.

## Deploy

> [!WARNING]
> This is a brand new project being "agentically engineered" rapidly. It's self editing features are very powerful, but inherently prone to prompt injection like OpenClaw. Be considerate of what data and tools you give it access to. Use at your own risk.

You'll need:

- **Node 24 LTS** and **pnpm**:
  ```bash
  nvm install 24 && nvm use 24
  npm install -g pnpm
  ```
- **Cloudflare account** — the free Workers plan works if you bring your own model.
  - Workers AI (the default Kimi setup) needs the **Workers Paid plan** ($5/mo).
  - Pi proxy (ChatGPT) and OpenRouter both run on the free plan.
- **[Exa](https://exa.ai) API key** — free $10 credit, effectively unlimited for personal use. Required for search.

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bensenescu/downy
cd downy
pnpm install
```

Login into Cloudflare with Wrangler

```
npx wrangler login         # one-time browser OAuth to your Cloudflare account
```

Set up env vars and deploy:

- Set secrets via `npx wrangler secret put EXA_API_KEY` (and other required secrets).
- Configure TEAM_DOMAIN and POLICY_AUD via `npx wrangler secret put` or the Cloudflare dashboard after Access is set up.

```
pnpm deploy
```

The Worker rejects every request until Cloudflare Access is in front of it — that's next.

## Authentication: Cloudflare Access

By putting Downy behind Cloudflare Access, it gates all traffic to the service unless you've authenticated. This authentication is managed by Cloudflare, not Downy. By default, Cloudflare Access adds the email tied to your Cloudflare Account to the allow list and authenticates by sending a One Time Password to your email.

Here is how you set it up:

1. **Go to your Worker's settings** in the Cloudflare dashboard:
   - Open the sidebar and find **Workers & Pages**.
   - Click into your **downy** worker.
   - Open the **Settings** tab.
2. **Turn on Cloudflare Access:**
   - Under **Domains & Routes**, click the three-dot menu next to your `workers.dev` value.
   - Toggle **Cloudflare Access** on.
   - A modal pops up with your `TEAM_DOMAIN` and `POLICY_AUD`.
3. **Set those values as secrets:**
   - `npx wrangler secret put TEAM_DOMAIN` — paste `https://<team>.cloudflareaccess.com`
   - `npx wrangler secret put POLICY_AUD` — paste the `<aud-tag>`
4. `pnpm deploy`, then open your Worker URL and log in.

<details>
<summary>Sign-in works but you still see "Authentication required"?</summary>

`pnpm tail` shows the verifier's failure reason — usually `TEAM_DOMAIN` missing `https://` or a stale `POLICY_AUD`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Deploy fails with <code>VPC service ... does not exist</code>?</summary>

`PI_RELAY_VPC_SERVICE_ID` should be unset in `.env` by default. If you set it, either remove it or follow [`docs/pi-proxy-setup.md`](docs/pi-proxy-setup.md) to provision the VPC service.

## Optional: ChatGPT subscription

Point Downy at your **ChatGPT Plus/Pro subscription** instead of Kimi:

- **Smarter models at a flat rate** — no per-token API billing.
- **Secure by network boundary** — a small proxy on your hardware holds the OAuth tokens, reached only via a Cloudflare Tunnel + Workers VPC binding (never the public internet).
- **Walkthrough:** [`docs/pi-proxy-setup.md`](docs/pi-proxy-setup.md).

> Note: OpenAI currently allows third-party harnesses to use ChatGPT subscriptions for personal use, but that policy could change.

## CI

```bash
pnpm run ci:check       # prettier + knip + tsc + oxlint
pnpm run format:write
pnpm run lint:fix
```
